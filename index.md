# Welcome to my OSCP training blog
A while ago, I decided to take the OSCP exam, I also decided to get my hands dirty with vulnerable VMs.

I created this page as learning material/practice for fellow geeks that would like to take the OSCP exam.

This is just what i do to practice for the exam and it is **by no means** an official guide for the exam.
I will periodically upload writeups of vulnerable VMs found online and maybe other security related material too.

## Short Bio
I'm a full stack software engineer with a passion for devOps and offensive security.
